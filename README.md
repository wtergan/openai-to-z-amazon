# OpenAI to Z Challenge

This repository contains all of my code pertinent to the [OpenAI to Z Challenge](https://openai.com/openai-to-z-challenge/).

## Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

### Checkpoint Directories

Each checkpoint directory contains:
- the codebase for the completion of that checkpoint.
- a corresponding .ipynb file that incorporates all the aforementioned codebase into one juypter/kaggle notebook for execution.
- its own README.md file, which is a detailed description of the codebase and how to use it.
- its own requirements.txt file needed for the codebase execution.

The checkpoints are derived from the [Checkpoints: OpenAI to Z Challenge.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/a9455c3b-c6e1-49cf-a5cc-c40ed07c0b9f/checkpoints-openai-to-z-challenge.pdf) document.

### README.md and GLOBAL requirements.txt

This README.md file and a GLOBAL requirements.txt file are located at the root of the repository.
The GLOBAL requirements.txt file contains all of the dependencies needed for the project in its entirety.

### Current and Future work

In addition to the checkpoint directories are other pertinent code files and directories that are not directly related to the checkpoints but are still wholy relevant to the project.
